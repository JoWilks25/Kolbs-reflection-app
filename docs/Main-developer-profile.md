A Senior Full Stack Developer with 7+ years of professional experience (2018-present), including technical leadership, mentorship, and independent project delivery. I need your help with creating tech specs, breaking down JIRA tickets, and providing time estimates based on my specific skillset and working pace.

CORE TECHNICAL STACK:
- Frontend: React.js (hooks-based - primary focus), Angular, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
- Data Visualization: d3.js, Qlik integration (Enigma.js, Nebula.js), custom chart implementations
- Backend: Node.js (Express) - current focus, Python (scripting and previous production work)
- Desktop Applications: Electron.js (recent experience), Tkinter
- DevOps: AWS, Azure, Cloudflare, Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD automation)
- Testing: Playwright/Puppeteer (integration testing), unit testing for critical functions
- Tools: Figma, Git, technical documentation (LLM-assisted)

KEY STRENGTHS:
- Complex System Integration: Expert at integrating multiple systems with proper authentication/permissioning. I consider simple integrations as working with unified codebases where I can make cross-team changes. Complex integrations involve proprietary blackbox APIs with outdated documentation and multi-source data aggregation (2+ systems for permissions/data).
- Full Stack Prototyping: Experienced designing and building complete prototypes from UI to backend, with emphasis on rapid MVP delivery
- Micro Frontends & Microservices: Architectural experience with modular, scalable applications
- Quick Learning: Rapidly adopt new technologies across diverse projects

WORKING STYLE:
- Primarily solo work currently, with extensive team collaboration experience
- Organized, proactive, focused on delivering tangible user value
- Strong coordination skills across backend, product, testing, and DevOps teams

ESTIMATION GUIDELINES:

Time Units: Hours/days preferred (story points when required by team process)

Baseline Development Times:
- Traditional backend work (CRUD/API creation): 1 day
- Basic UI component: 0.25 days (2 hours)
- API integration: 0.5 days (4 hours)

Complexity Multipliers (apply to base estimates):
- Legacy code integration: 2x
- Third-party API quirks/blackbox systems: 3x
- Cross-browser compatibility requirements: 1.5x
- Complex state management (debounced search, multi-state optimization): 2x

Testing Allocation:
- MVP projects: No test writing (0%)
- Production applications: 10% for unit tests (simple functions only), 30-40% for integration tests (Playwright/Puppeteer style) in mature applications
- Note: I use LLM assistance for test generation when required

Documentation Time:
- I add dedicated time blocks for documentation (use LLM-assisted codebase documentation)
- Inline comments added where necessary during development
- Greenfield projects: Create spec docs upfront, update as implementation diverges (tracked via LLM analysis)

Code Review Overhead:
- MVP/Solo projects: 5% maximum
- Team environments: Up to 25% (varies by team seniority, composition, and project velocity requirements)

Deployment Overhead:
- Initial setup: GitHub Actions + dev/prod environments (one-time cost)
- Ongoing: Minimal once automated
- Platforms: AWS, Azure, Cloudflare experience

Legacy Code Approach:
- Start with smaller bug tickets to familiarize with codebase
- Manually explore application features
- Review existing documentation if available
- Build understanding before tackling larger features

Greenfield Approach:
- Write specification documents first
- Document architecture and key decisions
- Update docs as implementation evolves

When creating tech specs, JIRA tickets, or time estimates, factor in my full-stack capabilities, rapid prototyping skills, and the complexity multipliers listed above. I work efficiently on standard features but account for significant overhead when dealing with proprietary systems, legacy code, or complex multi-system integrations. Adjust testing and documentation time based on project maturity (MVP vs. production). I can handle both independent work and team collaboration effectively.
